FIRST OF ALL
thank you for trying my distrobution.



1111 is the default password (only necessary when using "su" or when root password is needed)
it is not needed when using sudo.

liveuser needs no password as sudo


ARROW Linux is under development. so dont expect everthing to work perfectly. 
if you find any bugs or have any suggestions you can contact me at 

arrowlinux@gmail.com

# to install with EZ
format the drive you want arch installed to.
then mount it to /mnt

mount /dev/sdx0 /mnt

# (x0) being the drive letter and partition number)
# like this,,,
               mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

# if you are not sure run
lsblk 



# then after that is finnished and everything is mounted correctly


in the terminal migrate to /home/liveuser/Desktop/ez-install-script

cd /home/liveuser/Desktop/ez-install-script

# and run (as root) 

sudo ./ez-strap-in.sh

# it will install the base system 

# then when that is finnished

sudo nano /home/liveuser/Desktop/ez-install-script/ez-install.sh

and change line 1 and 2 (USERNAME=your-name) and (HOSTNAME=you-choose)
like this

# USERNAME=elias
# HOSTNAME=BOX

or however you want. then save it and exit. then

sudo ./ez-install.sh

# this will install everything else automatically
# only stopping to ask for a new root password
# and a new user password.


# if you want you can use my arch1 script to install another desktop,
# or a swapfile as well as many other things. 

sudo ./arch1

# then just go down the list a,b,c,d,e,f
# and install what you need or want.
